            <h2>Why Bow Tuning Matters</h2>
            <p>A properly tuned bow shoots more accurately, consistently, and safely. Even small adjustments can significantly impact your shooting performance. Regular maintenance ensures your equipment remains reliable and safe to use.</p>
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> Proper form has the most impact on performance. You need relatively consistent shooting form before bow tuning will make a noticeable difference.</p>

            <h2>Basic Bow Setup</h2>
            <p>If you purchased your bow from an archery shop, they should have performed the basic setup. However, understanding these fundamentals helps you maintain and adjust your equipment.</p>

            <h3>Essential Components</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Riser:</strong> The central handle section of the bow</li>
                <li><strong>Limbs:</strong> The flexible arms that store and release energy</li>
                <li><strong>String:</strong> Connects the limb tips and launches the arrow</li>
                <li><strong>Arrow Rest:</strong> Supports the arrow during the draw and release</li>
                <li><strong>Nocking Point:</strong> Marks where the arrow attaches to the string</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Assembly Basics</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Attach limbs to the riser, ensuring proper alignment</li>
                <li>String the bow carefully (consider using a bow stringer for safety)</li>
                <li>Install and adjust the arrow rest</li>
                <li>Set the nocking point on the string</li>
                <li>Add any accessories (sight, stabilizer, etc.)</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Tuning Adjustments</h2>

            <h3>Brace Height</h3>
            <p>The distance between the deepest part of the grip and the string when the bow is undrawn.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Manufacturer Recommendation:</strong> Check your bow's specifications for suggested range</li>
                <li><strong>Typical Range:</strong> 7-9 inches for most recurve bows</li>
                <li><strong>Adjustment:</strong> Twist or untwist the string to change brace height</li>
                <li><strong>Effect:</strong> Affects arrow speed, noise, and hand shock</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Nocking Point Position</h3>
            <p>The location on the string where you attach the arrow nock.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> About 1/8" above square (perpendicular to the rest)</li>
                <li><strong>Fine Tuning:</strong> Adjust based on arrow flight and grouping</li>
                <li><strong>Tools Needed:</strong> Nocking point pliers and serving material</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Center Shot (Arrow Rest Position)</h3>
            <p>Horizontal alignment of the arrow rest in relation to the bow's center.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Setup:</strong> Arrow should appear slightly left of center (for right-handed shooters)</li>
                <li><strong>Checking Alignment:</strong> Look down the arrow while at full draw</li>
                <li><strong>Fine Tuning:</strong> Adjust based on arrow impact patterns</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
