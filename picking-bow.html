            <h2>Before You Buy: Key Considerations</h2>
            <p>Selecting your first bow is one of the most important decisions in your archery journey. The right bow will help you develop proper form, while the wrong one can lead to frustration and bad habits.</p>

            <h3>Define Your Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Target Shooting:</strong> Recreational shooting at targets for fun and accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>Competitive Archery:</strong> Tournament shooting and Olympic-style competition</li>
                <li><strong>Bow Hunting:</strong> Using archery for hunting game animals</li>
                <li><strong>Traditional Archery:</strong> Historical and instinctive shooting styles</li>
                <li><strong>General Recreation:</strong> Casual shooting for enjoyment and exercise</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Critical Measurements</h2>
            
            <h3>Draw Length</h3>
            <p>Your draw length is the distance from the nocking point to the grip when at full draw. This measurement is crucial for proper form and safety.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple Estimation:</strong> Draw Length = Wingspan ÷ 2.5</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Measurement:</strong> Have an archery shop measure you accurately</li>
                <li><strong>Typical Ranges:</strong> Adults usually fall between 26-32 inches</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Draw Weight</h3>
            <p>Draw weight is the force required to pull the bowstring to your anchor point. Starting too heavy is the most common beginner mistake.</p>
            
            <h4>Recommended Starting Weights:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adult Men:</strong> 25-35 lbs</li>
                <li><strong>Adult Women:</strong> 15-25 lbs</li>
                <li><strong>Youth (12-17):</strong> 15-25 lbs</li>
                <li><strong>Children (8-12):</strong> 10-20 lbs</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> You should be able to draw and hold the bow comfortably for 30+ seconds. If you're struggling, the weight is too high.</p>

            <h2>Bow Selection by Type</h2>

            <h3>Choosing a Recurve Bow</h3>
            <p>Best for beginners wanting to learn fundamental archery skills or those interested in Olympic-style shooting.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Riser Quality:</strong> Invest more in the riser (handle) than the limbs</li>
                <li><strong>Limb Upgrades:</strong> Plan to upgrade limbs as you increase draw weight</li>
                <li><strong>Length Considerations:</strong> Longer bows (66-70") are more stable and forgiving</li>
                <li><strong>Material Options:</strong> Aluminum risers offer good value; carbon/wood for premium feel</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Choosing a Compound Bow</h3>
            <p>Ideal for hunting, longer practice sessions, or those wanting mechanical advantages.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Adjustability:</strong> Look for adjustable draw weight and length for growing into the bow</li>
                <li><strong>Let-Off Percentage:</strong> 70-80% let-off is standard for beginners</li>
                <li><strong>Cam Types:</strong> Single cams are easier to tune; dual cams offer more speed</li>
                <li><strong>Package Deals:</strong> Many come with sight, rest, and stabilizer included</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Choosing a Traditional Bow</h3>
            <p>For those seeking an authentic, instinctive archery experience.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Length Matters:</strong> Longer bows (68-72") are more forgiving for beginners</li>
                <li><strong>Wood Types:</strong> Different woods affect performance and appearance</li>
                <li><strong>Grip Style:</strong> Low wrist grip reduces torque and improves accuracy</li>
                <li><strong>String Materials:</strong> Dacron strings are traditional; modern materials offer better performance</li>
            </ul>
