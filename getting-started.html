            <h2>Safety First: Non-Negotiable Rules</h2>
            <p>Archery safety is paramount and must be followed without exception. These rules protect you and everyone around you.</p>

            <h3>Fundamental Safety Rules</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Never point a bow at anyone:</strong> Treat every bow as if it's loaded and ready to fire</li>
                <li><strong>Only shoot when all clear:</strong> Ensure the range is clear of people before shooting</li>
                <li><strong>Know what's beyond your target:</strong> Be aware of what lies beyond your target in case of a miss</li>
                <li><strong>Never dry fire your bow:</strong> Shooting without an arrow can damage the bow and cause injury</li>
                <li><strong>Inspect equipment before use:</strong> Check for cracks, damage, or wear before each session</li>
                <li><strong>Follow range commands immediately:</strong> "Cease fire" means stop shooting instantly</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Personal Protective Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Arm Guard:</strong> Protects your bow arm from string slap</li>
                <li><strong>Finger Tab or Glove:</strong> Protects fingers from the string</li>
                <li><strong>Chest Guard (optional):</strong> Prevents clothing interference with the string</li>
                <li><strong>Closed-toe shoes:</strong> Protect feet from dropped arrows</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Range Etiquette and Procedures</h2>

            <h3>Before You Shoot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Check in with range staff or instructor</li>
                <li>Understand the range layout and rules</li>
                <li>Set up your equipment at your assigned position</li>
                <li>Wait for the "all clear" signal before handling arrows</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>During Shooting</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shoot only forward:</strong> Never turn around with a nocked arrow</li>
                <li><strong>One arrow at a time:</strong> Nock, draw, aim, and release one arrow before nocking another</li>
                <li><strong>Stay in your lane:</strong> Don't cross into other shooters' areas</li>
                <li><strong>No talking during shooting:</strong> Maintain concentration for all shooters</li>
                <li><strong>Stop immediately on command:</strong> Range safety officer commands override everything</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Retrieving Arrows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wait for the "all clear" to retrieve arrows</li>
                <li>Walk, don't run to the targets</li>
                <li>Look for arrows that missed the target</li>
                <li>Pull arrows straight back out of targets</li>
                <li>Carry arrows with points down when walking back</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your First Shooting Session</h2>

            <h3>Finding a Place to Start</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Archery Ranges:</strong> Supervised environment with equipment rental</li>
                <li><strong>Archery Clubs:</strong> Often offer beginner classes and experienced guidance</li>
                <li><strong>Sporting Goods Stores:</strong> Some have indoor ranges for trying equipment</li>
                <li><strong>Outdoor Education Centers:</strong> May offer archery as part of programs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <p>Your first session should focus on safety, basic form, and getting comfortable with the equipment rather than accuracy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Start Close:</strong> Begin at 5-10 yards from a large target</li>
                <li><strong>Focus on Form:</strong> Concentrate on consistent stance and release</li>
                <li><strong>Expect Fatigue:</strong> Archery uses muscles you may not be used to exercising</li>
                <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Accuracy comes with practice and proper form development</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Basic Shooting Sequence</h2>

            <h3>The Six-Step Process</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Stance:</strong> Position feet shoulder-width apart, body perpendicular to target</li>
                <li><strong>Nocking:</strong> Place arrow on the string at the nocking point</li>
                <li><strong>Drawing:</strong> Pull the string back to your anchor point smoothly</li>
                <li><strong>Anchoring:</strong> Establish consistent hand position on your face</li>
                <li><strong>Aiming:</strong> Align sight or arrow tip with target</li>
                <li><strong>Release:</strong> Let fingers relax to release the string cleanly</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Follow-Through</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hold your position after release</li>
                <li>Watch the arrow's flight to the target</li>
                <li>Note what felt right or wrong about the shot</li>
                <li>Stay in position until the arrow hits</li>
            </ul>
